# CazooCarValuatiion
This repository contains a test automation suite written in Java using Selenium WebDriver and following the Page Object Model (POM) design pattern. It automates the car valuation process by extracting vehicle registration numbers from an input file, performing searches on Cazoo.co.uk website, and comparing the results with expected output data.
